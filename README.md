# HorexSwiftStudyTest
I want to learn Swift, but because of my lazy, i faste lots of times in other useless things.And this is my third time that i want to learn code swift deeply.
so i create this project in github and make a plan to learn it instead of just learn a little like last two time.
and i will push daily code and write standard as possible as i can; 
That all!
